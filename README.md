## Features
- **Floating Window:** Displays a floating window when the screen is turned on.
- **Room Database:** Utilizes Room for storing and managing data locally, keeping track of study sessions, tasks, and notes.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Implemented using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to separate concerns and maintain clean code.
- **BroadcastReceiver:** Uses a BroadcastReceiver to monitor system events like screen on/off to trigger floating window visibility.
- **Chat GPT Integration:** A built-in chatbot powered by GPT for answering study-related questions or providing explanations on various topics.
